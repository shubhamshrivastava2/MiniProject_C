## Introduction
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM : The main aim of this project is to develop software for library management system. It is e-library-management system. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly. This project is developed using c language and. Hence it provides the complete solution for the current management system.

In library management system, we can easily add books information by user choice by add_book function. After that it displays the informatoin entered by user. On the other hand, the user can view list of all books available in library

* For large libraries data management is one of the most important tasks.They need to keep a track of all their books as well as their status.
* This can be a very difficult task as libraries have a very large number of books and other articles.

## Research
### Advantages
* Easy record maintenace.
* Reduce data redundancy.
* Reducing entry of wrong data.
* Increasing security as only authorised personnel can access the data.
### Disadvantages
* Requirement of techincally trained staff.
* High cost of system.
* Costly maintenance.
* Needs regular backup of data.
